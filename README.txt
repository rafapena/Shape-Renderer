Notes:
- In script.js, between "EDITABLE REGION" and "GUI operations", there are a set of literal values that can edited before running the program, which are not specified in the GUI
- While in the application, the user must first hit the "Load File" button to load a file into the GUI
- Upon hitting "Save File", the .obj file, with normalized vertices from [-1, 1], will be downloaded
